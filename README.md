══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
💥 SPECIAL ATTACKS - LIMIT BREAK SYSTEM
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every character has a powerful SPECIAL ability that charges during combat!

⚡ CHARGING YOUR LIMIT GAUGE:
• Taking damage fills your gauge (more damage = faster charging!)
• Defeating enemies grants gauge to your whole party
• Watch the bar below each character's sprite
• Gauge turns from gold to pink when fully charged!

🌟 USING YOUR SPECIAL:
• At 100% gauge, "Attack" becomes "✨ Special ✨" (rainbow text!)
• Specials cost 0 MP - always usable when ready!
• Specials have HIGHEST priority - they always go first!
• Using a Special depletes your gauge back to 0%

⚠️ GAUGE RESETS:
• Getting KO'd resets your gauge to 0%
• Entering the Tavern resets all gauges
• Gauge persists between waves within a dungeon

💀 CLASS SPECIALS:

🗡️ BARBARIAN - Bloodfury
   Unleash 11 rapid strikes on random enemies, healing for all damage dealt!
   
⚔️ VALKYRIE - Battle Cry
   Rally your allies! Grants Empower3 + Fury to the ENTIRE party and heals everyone!
   
🥷 NINJA - Night Slash
   Strike ALL enemies with a devastating shadow attack and poison them all!
   
🔮 SORCERESS - Meteor Storm
   Rain destruction from above! Multiple magic hits on random enemies with stat debuffs!
   
🌟 SHAMAN - Elemental Fury
   Channel all four elements in sequence: Hydro, Fire, Frost, then Shock - hitting all enemies!
   
⛪ BISHOP - Angelic Chorus
   Divine intervention! Fully restore HP and MP for the entire party AND revive all fallen allies!
   
🥋 MONK - Nirvana Fist
   Achieve enlightenment! Full self-heal, gain all buffs (Empower3/Fury/Lifelink), then deliver a massive strike!

💡 SPECIAL TIPS:
• Barbarians charge faster when Raging (taking 2x damage = 2x gauge!)
• Glass cannon classes (Sorceress, Bishop) charge quickly due to low HP
• Tanks (Monk, Valkyrie) charge slower but their Specials are worth the wait
• Empower and Lifelink buffs enhance damage-dealing Specials!
• Save Specials for tough waves or boss fights for maximum impact!
